Task 3

How to reuse the module:

To make use of the LoggerAspect module, there are two elements to define in the application specific composition. 
First, you need to define the pointcuts. There are two pointcuts ("pointcutSet1", "pointcutSet2"). They are 
separated to define behavior "before" and "after" the jointpoints. Then, you must define the functions 
("loggingSet1", "loggingSet2") which will be called in the advice.
