## Instructions

### Config
Make sure that ajc is on your path by typing: export PATH=$HOME/aspectj1.9/bin/:$PATH
Make sure aspectjrt is on your classpath by typing: export CLASSPATH=$HOME/aspectj1.9/lib/aspectjrt.jar:$CLASSPATH

## Note
To run each task follow the readme in each task.

## Alternative
It may be difficult to compile AspectJ files in the command line.  
It is better to compile the woven_bankwithlogging project in Eclipse as an AspectJ Project.  
Make sure the AspectJ plugin is installed in Eclipse.  
Run the program as an AspectJ application from Eclipse.
