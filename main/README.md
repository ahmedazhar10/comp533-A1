# Assignment 1
OS: MacOS X

### Instructions
Open Terminal    
1. Go to the directory where the project folder is located    
2. Run "ajc - 1.5 task\<number>\/\*.java task\<number>\/\*.aj"  
3. Run "java task\<number>\.BankWithLogging"  

Note:
It may be difficult to compile AspectJ files in the command line.  
It is better to compile the woven_bankwithlogging in Eclipse as an AspectJ Project.  
Make sure the AspectJ extension is installed in Eclipse.  
Run the program as an AspectJ application from Eclipse.
